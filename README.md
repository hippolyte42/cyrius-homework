## Requirements

For development, you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed in your environement & an API running with the expect routes (I use [Mockoon](https://mockoon.com/) to mock one).

## Running the project
    
    $ cd my-app/
    $ npm i         // install dependencies
    $ npm start     // run front client

## Running end-to-end tests
    
    $ cd my-app/
    $ npm i                   // install dependencies
    $ npm run test:headed     // run playwright tests in headed mode
    $ npm run test:codegen    // run playwright tests codegen https://playwright.dev/docs/codegen
